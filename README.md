# k-means-and-silhouette-coefficient
HW 2: Due 2/151.
1.A. Implement* the simple k-means algorithm.  Download the Clustering.xlsx file from MyCourses and cluster the data beginning with k=2 and increasing by 2 in each iteration; stop with k=20. Plot the sum of squared error for the iterations and find the “knee” of the graph. What is the optimal k? B. Using the same dataset and Weka’s EM implementation, run EM on the data using the numClusters= -1 parameter.  What is the kgenerated by the algorithm?  Does the EM kvalue match the one you chose for k-means in Part 1? Why or why not? 2.Implement the silhouette coefficient and test the quality of clusters generated by the optimal kfound in Part 1 for each method.
